					<div class="textStyle3">
						Nobody likes to be just anybody. When you spend your time and money somewhere, whether in a shop or an online store, acknowledgement is expected, help is appreciated, but service is the winner. Who wouldn't like walking into a store, being greeted by name with a smile, and having the clerk say, "Oh, I'm glad you passed by, we have just received this new item that I think you would love"?
						<br/><br/>
						Online shopping isn't any different. Offer a personalized 1-to-1 experience to your ecommerce customers and they will came back for more, and more.

					<h1 class="size20 top-space">How it works</h2>
					<div class="textStyle1">
						There are many tools that allow you to market 1-to-1 to your customers. An important tool is the ability to suggest other products according to your customer's habits or those of customers like them. These suggestions can be based on "other products usually bought with that one," "those who bought that product also bought this one," and "other customers who have bought the products you have viewed also bought/were interested in these ones." 
						<br/><br/>
						By tracking a customer's visit to your site you can help them through their buying process. If they have viewed a product multiple times without purchasing it, forward a product sheet to them or other related content that may be useful. You can also set up a call or an online chat session to answer any of their questions, or target them with a promo that discounts the coveted item.
						<br/><br/>
						The powerful REST API used in MogoBiz allows you welcome your customer to a fit-for-purpose web page depending on where they come from, such as an ad or a facebook link. If the link is related to a specific product line, the page they land on can be customized to highlight that product, so your customer won't need to search your site for the product of interest.
						<br/><br/>
						The MogoBiz solution puts an emphasis on customer data. Customer information, like identity and likes &amp; dislikes, are shared over your entire commerce site and channels, so you always know who you're interacting with and, more importantly, the customer recognizes it.
