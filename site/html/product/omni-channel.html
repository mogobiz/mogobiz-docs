						You don't necessarily need to be everywhere, but it's nice to know that you can be. As your business needs, markets and offerings expand, so too can your sales touch-points. Indeed, gone are the days when selling products was a one-platform reality. Even small online shops are integrating customer-generated content through comments or social media input. Apps are no longer a mystery. The hour of omni-channel commerce has arrived.

						As a marketing professional, you know that a consistent brand experience is crucial to maintain coherent – and enjoyable! – customer experiences. Your multichannel strategy must follow that lead. Whether online, in-store, on mobile phones or tablets, social media sites, apps, print, call centers or any other point of sales, the buying process must be seamless, targeted and easy.

					<div class="textStyle2 top-small-space">
						The evolution of technology and programming languages is making real-time data across multiple platforms possible. MogoBiz uses both HTML5 and REST APIs for the integration of complex web applications. 
						<br/><br/>
						HTML5 allows for the flexibility and performance you expect from the web to also run on low-powered devices, such as mobile phones and tablets. It supports exciting content like images, videos and dashboards. And all this content is cross-platform. 
						<br/><br/>
						APIs are the interface between your backend and front end, or databases and web &amp; mobile interfaces. REST APIs is an architectural approach to those interfaces that makes hypermedia possible over cross-channels. REST APIs are simple interfaces that are easily modifiable, they are very scalable and assure top performance, so information exchanges between your system and your customer is done seamlessly, no matter traffic peaks or the interface your customer is using.
