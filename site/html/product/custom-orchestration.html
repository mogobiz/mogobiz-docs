						You should make it as easy as possible for your customers to buy your product. Right? Right. Still, some sites don't seem to understand this.
						<br/><br/>
						When was the last time you were on an ecommerce site, had a basket full of items, and was informed only at check out that some of them were out of stock? Or, worse, at check out you're asked to log in or create a profile and once you do, your basket winds up empty and you must start the whole buying process over again. Admit it, if you did not leave the site right away (because you really wanted to buy those items!), you at least thought of it while doing some deep breathing exercises to calm yourself down. 
						<br/><br/>
						Like a "Choose your own adventure" novel, an ecommerce site has many possible variables. Make sure none come to a dead-end.

					<div class="size20 top-space">How it works</div>
					<div class="textStyle1 top-space">
						Orchestration refers to the customer journey throughout your site. Or, in other words, to each buying stage: searching for items, looking at their content, adding items to a basket (or wish list), going to check out, profile log in or creation, inserting billing and payment information, inserting shipping info, purchase confirmation, and throughout the entire process the possibility of modifying the quantity of or deleting an item, or postponing the purchase. 
						<br/><br/>
						These stages are frontend specific; they are part of what the customer sees. They are linked to backend machines, such as your content management repository, an external payment system and possibly your company's ERP solution, through APIs, that act like translators.
						<br/><br/>
						MogoBiz uses REST APIs, an internet-based API that is scalable and resilient, and ensures solid frontend creations. With it you can easily modify your customer journey to suit their probable trajectories and your business.

					<div class="textStyle1 top-space">
						MogoBiz's solution also allows you to go a step further and offer a dynamically customizable environment to your customers. For example, if you know that a customer landed on your site after clicking on an ad that offered a promo code, that code can be automatically inserted into the promo code field and the purchase reflect its discount, instead of having the customer copy &amp; paste the code upon check out to have the discount applied to the purchase. Or, you can ask your customer when they want to receive their items and show which can be shipped and delivered at that time before purchase completion.
