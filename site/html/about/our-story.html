						Yoann joined Ebiznext right out of school in 2004, where he works as a developer and project manager.  Meeting deadlines is his motivator, and he likes to see a job well done. To date, he is most proud of the work he did within the Navigo Passes Top-Up Project. Navigo is the transportation card for the Paris subway system. The project consisted of writing on a card chip from a web app that recognizes the different card types. Yoann found the project really interesting to develop and is glad of how well it works. On the MogoBiz project he developed the modules that allow for data and server integration into the Jahia CMS. He thinks MogoBiz, what with its seamless integration with a CMS, will be a game changer for the ecommerce industry.
