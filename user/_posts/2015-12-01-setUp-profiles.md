According to each user's skills and role within the company (finance, sales, marketing, pricing, etc.), the administrator can set up as many specific **profiles** as required.

In order to make this step as easy as possible, Mogobiz has created three **standard profiles** that can be customized and adapted to specific needs:

* An **admin** profile, which defines the employee in charge of the store, profiles and users creation processes.
* A **validator** profile, which defines the employee in charge of managing one or several stores and products that need validation (such as services or downloadable products).
* A **seller** profile, which defines the employee in charge of managing one or several stores and products that don't need validation.
* Click on **admin**, or **validator**, or **seller**
