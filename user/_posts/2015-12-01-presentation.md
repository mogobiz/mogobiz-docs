Mogobiz is an open source modular software solution for e-commerce. It is available in SaaS mode or can be hosted in your own environment.\\
This user document will walk you through the process of setting up your Mogobiz store. It is intended for first time users who want to generate a simple, powerful and full-featured eCommerce platform. No technical expertise is required.

To set up the ecommerce platform, the administrator needs to first create **a store**, by entering:

1. Its **general** information (name, adress, website, etc.), 
2. The **profiles** : users' authorizations to operate on one or several stores
3. The **users**:  authentification informations of the users authorized to operate on one or several stores.

Once the store is created, the ecommerce platform is organized as below:

1. A store. Its objective is to display products to sell. 
Each product is created independently, with its own description and illustration. For an optimized visibility, those products (skirts, rental, concert) are created within categories (clothes, services, tickets, etc.), and each categories belongs to a unique store. 
2. A catalog. It is set for a limited period of time, for seasonal collections or holidays for example. There can be several catalogs, as many as needed, that can be turned on or off. Products are organized inside a catalog through a hierarchy of categories.
3. Categories. They host products and services that share common features. They can host an unlimited number of products. 
4. Products. They have permanent features (materials, size, color) listed in the category section. Any product can vary - according to customers' requests and stock availability. These variations can include size or colors for example. Those variations are listed in the product section and create an SKU (Stock Keeping Units). 
5. Each of these SKUs have then a unique feature value, hence a unique identifier referring to the particular SKU.
